# Welcome to the fleet ensign!

 Thanks for reporting ensign. We've yanked out of civilian pilot life to serve in the pride and joy of earths united colonies. We have several unknown signals from 100 light years away. We lack pilots to explore the edge of our influence due to existing fleet commitments. Time is passing. We do not have time for a lengthy introduction. You must immediately get you up to speed with your Typescript class spaceship.   

Head over to your [hanguar](https://github.com/quantumjs/spaceship-hanguar) and get a brief look at all the functions of your craft.             

We will train you in all aspects of your ship. You have one week to prepare before your first mission.

Sergeant Brandy Lennox will be your instructor next week. 

God speed ensign, 

General Andred Mira of 4th TypeScript scout division
